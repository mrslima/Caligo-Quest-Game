# Caligo Quest

Caligo Quest is a board game inspired by Roguelite mechanics, where you build the dungeon as you progress, ensuring that each game is always unique and full of surprises!

Each turn, explore the dungeon, collect exclusive items, and face other players in battles. The first player to find the Key and escape through the Gate wins (or the last surviving player if no one manages to escape).

Can you find the Key and reach the Gate first?
